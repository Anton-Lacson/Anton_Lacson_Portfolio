### About me
Hi! My name is Anton Lacson, I was born and raised on the Island of Guam and moved to Minnesota to pursue my bachelors degree at the University of St. Thomas. 
I am on my last semester of college and getting ready to graduate with a major in Computer Science with double minors in Business Analytics and Data Science. 
Throughout my time in college, I have developed and improved my critical thinking and technical skills. Computer Science is a versatile major with many things you 
get into after college. Throughout my time in college, I realized that my interest in computer science lies in the realm of data analysis and problem solving. 
Where I can assess data and give feedback that optimizes improvmements, which leads to better results and better performance within a business. Additionally, with my background in 
computer science, I will always have the technical skills I have developed throughout college to my advantage.
